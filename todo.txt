Hey everyone and welcome to the first of many developer posts!

I'd like to begin by introducing you to the **new** Os-Revolution.

**Introduction** - ||Here at Os-Revolution we strive to provide our players with a balance of challenge and reward and that's not changed! However we have upped the ante and added many more challenges while also creating new more exciting rewards.||

**Tl;DR** - ||We've made the gameplay more challenging and more rewarding to those who put in the grind.||


__**Home**__

Home has been redesigned:
||
```
Many new features have been added which I'll leave for you to discover, but I will say a new "Hall of Heroes" has been added for players who have achieved at least one 99.
```

__**The Exchange**__

A new grand exchange like feature that can be accessed through the exchange clerk or a bank booth.

**How it Works**
||
```
Once in the exchange players may "sell" items to it like a shop. These items will be listed for everyone else to view and buy.
Items are listed for their exchange price which will change with the market.
All like items are listed as one and the amount sold goes by oldest offer first.
When your offer sells you will receive a notification informing you how much of your listing sold, and for what price.
Players can collect their money and remove their listings through the "Collect" option
Market prices update once every 24 hours
```

__**Foraging**__

Foraging is the replacement for Farming. It involves foraging for different resourcesthrough out the world.

**How it Works**
||
```
Many farmable items are now naturally spawning foragable items. Things like herbs, flax, snape grass, coconuts, cacti to name a few.
Where they spawn varies by climate. For example you will only find cacti in desert climates.
These "nodes" do respawn and have a high chance of depleting so make sure you've got your best secateurs
Foraging clusters will also spawn and move around the world. These clusters contain various herbs.
The type of herbs and amount varies per cluster. Clusters in more high risk areas have a better chance of having better herbs

__**Skills**__

We have completely re-written most skills and have introduced some custom variations to the more tedious ones. With the goal of making them more rewarding to train. Don't worry if you don't see a skill on the list today it just means we've not gotten to it yet.

**Gathering Skills (Woodcutting,Mining,Farming,Fishing,Hunter)**: ||All gathering skills now scale better with equipment and level. Meaning having a higher level and better equipment will have a greater impact on your success rate and progress more naturally. There are now also an **Efficiency** and **Power** modifier **per skill** that will impact your chance to deplete what you're gathering and your chance to harvest respectively.||

**Farming**: ||Farming has been replaced with the **Foraging** skill. There are several methods of training including; Harvesting naturally spawning foraging node, and searching for and harvesting **foraging clusters**. **Secatuers** are the primary tool used to train foraging||

**Runecrafting**: ||For those of you who played Runecessor relax. We took a different approach this time. Players now must navigate the *dimensional rift* to access any altar of their choice as long as they have the correct talisman, or tiara.  ||
